These are the results of the pairwise T-Test comparisons

THe files prefixed with EvaluationRes refer to the comparisons between each pair of networks using only the results from the original evaluation runs
for eg: M_1 is compared with M_2, M_3 etc.. and for M_2, M_3 etc

The files prefixed with MorphCompare refers to the comparisons that were made between the a morphology and its respective Eval and ReEval runs (which are averaged over the 4 different comparisons made)
for eg: M_1(eval) is compared with M_1(ReEval), M_2(Eval) is compared with M_2(ReEval) etc
