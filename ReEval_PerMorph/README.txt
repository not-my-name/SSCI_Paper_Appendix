This is the folder storing the figures that compare the results for each of the re-evaluations
So each graph shows how each network performed when implemented with the various other morphologies

NOTE: That for morph_5 re-evaluations, morph_7 was compared instead of morph_1 
This is because Morph_5 was implemented by using Morph_1
