Illustrations of the fixed sensory configurations that were used during the evolution stages of the controllers

It should be noted that the evolved controller for Morphology_5 used Morphology_1 as a starting configuration but a random set of sensors were activated/deactivated at the start of each generation (as noted in the figure)

Since the networks for Morphology_1 and 5 are the same, the controller for Morphology_5 was implemented with the configuration labelled Comp_Morph as part of the evaluation phase of the investigation.
